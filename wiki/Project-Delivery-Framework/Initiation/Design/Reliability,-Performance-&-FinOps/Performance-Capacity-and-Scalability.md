## Purpose

Meet SLAs with optimized models, queries, and capacity management.

## Outcomes

Performance baselines, optimization playbooks, and capacity monitoring.

## Decisions to Make

- Partitioning/aggregations/caching
- Refresh strategy and concurrency targets
- Performance test coverage

## Standards & Patterns

- Star schemas and column pruning
- Delta optimization (partition, optimize/compact)
- DAX/SQL performance patterns

## Deliverables & Artifacts

- Performance test plan & results
- Optimization standards
- Capacity dashboards

## Checklist

- [ ] Baselines recorded
- [ ] Hot paths optimized
- [ ] Capacity monitored
- [ ] Regression tests in place

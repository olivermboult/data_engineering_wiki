## Outcomes

Well-documented semantic models, certified datasets, and clear consumption routes.

## Decisions to Make

- Model strategy (central, distributed, or hybrid)
- Thin vs. thick models; calculation placement
- Endorsement & distribution channels
- Legacy migration plan

## Standards & Patterns

- Star schemas and calculation standards
- Certified datasets for critical content
- App/workspace layout for consumers

## Deliverables & Artifacts

- Consumption architecture
- Semantic model standards
- Migration plan for reports

## Checklist

- [ ] Certified datasets defined
- [ ] Model design follows standards
- [ ] Distribution via apps set
- [ ] Legacy migration tracked

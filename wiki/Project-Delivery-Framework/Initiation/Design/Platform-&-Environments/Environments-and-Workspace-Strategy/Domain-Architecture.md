In Fabric, a domain is a way of logically grouping of data in an organisation that is relevant to a particular area or field. Domains are commonly used to group data by the following structures to manage data according to specific regulations, restrictions, and needs:
- Functional Structure
- Product/Project Structure
- Process-based Structure
- Region-based Structure

To group data into domains, workspaces are associated with domains. When a workspace is associated with a domain, all the items in the workspace are also associated with the domain, and they receive a domain attribute as part of their metadata.

A subdomain is a way for fine tuning the logical grouping of your data. You can create subdomains under domains.
